## Hi! My name is Alecto! Welcome to my github!

Iâ€™m currently working on a number of projects. These range from projects in C++
with ambitious scopes, to more down-to-earth projects. I'm currently a student,
and a few of the projects here are projects for some of my courses.

There are a few projects in particular that I'm looking to collaborate on! These
are:
- [Noam](https://github.com/codeinred/noam), a parser combinator library, and
- [Conduit](https://github.com/codeinred/conduit), a library for coroutines in C++ 20,

Both of these are at the stage where I feel that other people can start using
and experimenting with them, and I'd love for you to take a look at them!

### Reaching Out

I'm availible on [twitter](https://twitter.com/codeinred) and via email if you'd like to get
in touch, or if there's any improvements you see to any of my projects, feel
free to submit a pull request with your work!
